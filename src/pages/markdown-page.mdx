## What is SkyPoint Modern Data Stack (MDS) Platform?

SkyPointâ€™s mission is to bring people and data together.

Our vision of applications built on top of cloud data platforms is an audacious one, but the story to be written may involve two other key concepts: the lakehouse and the semantic layer.

Lakehouse brings together the benefits of a data lake and data warehouse to create a new open data management architecture based on Delta Lake. You can simplify and scale your enterprise data strategy while supporting BI and AI use cases in one place utilizing Databricks as the primary compute engine.The semantic layer is an evolution of the metric store and headless BI concepts that have arisen over the past few years to utilize tools like Dbt.

We are the industry's first Modern Data Stack Platform with built-in data lakehouse, account 360, customer 360, identity resolution, data privacy vault, ELT / Reverse ETL, data integration, privacy compliance automation, data governance, analytics, partner integrations and managed services for organizations in several industries including healthcare, life sciences, senior living, retail, hospitality, business services and financial services.
