# Setting up Klaviyo 
## Overview

You can read and write data to your Klaviyo account with your private API key. This API key should neither be exposed in client-side code nor made accessible from public repositories.

This document will guide you to create a private API key with a scope in [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/login?next=/account#api-keys-tab?). You can restrict third party access to protect your and your customersâ€™ data by creating a scope.

## Prerequisite

You should have access to an active [Klaviyo](https://www.klaviyo.com/login?next=/account) account. To manage the API keys, you must have an Owner, Admin, or Manager role on the account.
