### SkyPoint Dataflow:

- **Transformations** – The transformation feature of SkyPoint Cloud enables you to do any manipulations needed on the data to use it correctly. SkyPoint Cloud enables this with the help of dbt transformations with a very easy-to-use model setup of dbt. All the transformed entities are available in the "Bronze" tab under Lakehouse > Databases. Users can use the transformed tables for master data creation, audience building, metrics, predictions, and timelines.

### SkyPoint Resolve:

- **Multiple Master data creation per instance** – SkyPoint enables users to add as many master data profiles as required for their business units to take benefit of the golden profile created for business decisions. The multiple golden profiles created are available in the "Gold" tab under Lakehouse > Databases. All these entities can be loaded into any visualization tool for further insights. A few examples of master data are as follows:
  - Healthcare: Provider, Patient, Hospitals.
  - Senior living: Community, Resident, Provider, Facility, Staff.
  - Retail: Employee, Product, Feedback, Customers
