# Creating a Tenant
## Overview
You need a storage account to create various data flows for your customers. A Tenant in SkyPoint Modern Data Stack Platform (MDSP) provides you with the same for data storage and other purposes. Once your Tenant account gets created and registered in SkyPoint MDSP, a unique id is allotted to it to support mapping as well as other reference purposes in the database.
