# Connectors
## Overview

The connectors establish a connection between two applications to make the data exchange possible. By setting up a connector in your environment, you can facilitate a data integration from one internet-based software system to another. Examples of popular connectors are Azure, Salesforce, Google services, Amazon web services, and more. These data connectors enable you to combine various data sources into one integrated space.

SkyPoint Cloud comes with 200+ native connectors that collect and align data from your existing tools and technologies. With the help of connectors, you can import or export the data from the source platform to the destination platform.
