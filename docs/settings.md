The Platform settings hold a set of features or parameters of Modern Data Stack Platform (MDSP) property settings that are commonly applied by the user. These settings include detailed system administration that provides information about General settings such as Platform, Schedule, Instances, Tenants, and many others.

You can adjust and manage the platform configurations to control core platform behaviors across all SkyPoint solutions and streamline your business efforts. Any changes to the platform settings affect the configurations where you applied the procedure.

You have multiple features available to ensure that your instance is running as intended.

- Create and manage environments
