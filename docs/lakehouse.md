It takes the unstructured data from a data lake and utilizes the management features and tools from data warehouses to implement them together as a larger system. You can simplify and scale your enterprise data strategy while supporting Business Intelligence (BI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) use cases in one place utilizing Databricks as the primary computing engine.

Advantages of the Lakehouse are as follows:

- Flexible and low-cost storage.
- Supports advanced analytics workloads (Artificial Intelligence (AI), Business Intelligence (BI)) and predictive analytics to take advantage of the full set of data.
- Improve data governance.
- Manage any type of data (structured or unstructured).
