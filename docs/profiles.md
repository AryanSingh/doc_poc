# Master Data

## Overview

Master Data refers to profiles (customers, partners, citizens, suppliers, sites, providers, patients, operators, locations, products, assets, etc.) and it is a consistent, uniform set of identifiers and attributes that describe them, usually placed within a platform that supports efficient curation of the data. Examples of master data include customer data, product data, supplier data, financial data, etc.

SkyPoint's Master Data brings data together from across the enterprise and business ecosystem to create a single, accurate and transparent record of the truth.

All your profiles are created after a successfulÂ Resolve (map and unify) process. The Master Data consists of three features, namely:


|Items|Description|
