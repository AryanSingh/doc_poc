The Profile page enables you to see a holistic view of each individual customer by combining data from various sources. You can build a meaningful relationship with your customer. Each customer profile allows you to gain personalized experience of your customer such as preferences, interactions, and past events. 

All your profiles are created after a successful [Master Data Management (MDM) - Stitch process](stitch.md). The Profiles consists of three features, namely:  

|Items|Description|
| :- | :- |
|Customers|You can use the free search feature to view all your saved profiles on the Customers page. You can further add attributes that would enable indexing for searching and filtering your saved profiles on the Customers page.|
|Enrichment|Enrichment enables you to supplement your customer data with data from external sources including SkyPoint and other partners.|
|Timelines|You can enable your customers to view the timelines by defining the timeline data in their profiles across all your entities. These elements help to improve the monitoring and display of your customer data.|
