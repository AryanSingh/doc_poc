# Bring your own storage (BYOS)

SkyPoint platform offers over 200+ integrations and 100+ built-in data processing, data transformation and privacy compliance services that gives 
you the option to store all your data in your own cloud storage, databases and related services. 

We recommend BYOS for all production deployments. 

You can use private endpoints for your BYOS services to allow SkyPoint services on a virtual network (VNet) to securely 
access data over a Private Link. The private endpoint uses a separate IP address from the VNet address space for 
each BYOS service. Network traffic between SkyPoint and the BYOS accounts traverses over the VNet and 
a private link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public internet.

You can also use IP network rules to allow access from specific SkyPoint (proxy or NAT) IP address ranges by creating IP network rules. 
These rules grant access to specific SkyPoint services and blocks general internet traffic.
