# Resident 360## OverviewResident 360 in Master Data Management (MDM) involves creating a comprehensive view of the residents. The goal of Resident 360 is to provide complete and accurate information about the residents by integrating data from all relevant sources within an organization.## Step 1: Map tables and attributesMapping semantic type to attributes in Resident 360 is an important step in creating a comprehensive and accurate data model for the residents. By specifying the data type of each attribute, you can create a Resident 360 view and apply it to various downstream processes. For more details about the mapping process, refer to the [map](https://docs.skypointcloud.com/docs/map.html) section. Below are examples of how semantic types are mapped to specific attributes for Resident 360:- Text: Used to indicate that an attribute contains textual data, such as names, addresses, or notes. Examples of attributes in Resident 360 include "Resident.FirstName", "Resident.MiddleName", and " Resident.LastName".- Numeric: Used to indicate that an attribute contains numerical data, such as phone number, and age. An example of an attribute in Resident 360 includes "Resident.Phone".- Date/Time: Used to indicate that an attribute contains date or time data, such as date of birth, admission date, or discharge date. Examples of attributes in Resident 360 that might have a date/time semantic type include "Resident.BirthDate", "Resident.AdmissionDate", and "Resident.DischargeDate".- Boolean: Used to indicate that an attribute contains a true/false or yes/no value. An example of an attribute in Resident 360 includes "Resident.Active", which can be true if the resident is currently active and false if they are not.- Categorical: Used to indicate that an attribute contains a finite set of discrete values, such as gender (male, female, non-binary), marital status (single, married, divorced), or race/ethnicity (Asian, Black, Hispanic, etc.). Examples of attributes in Resident 360 that might have a categorical semantic type include "Resident.Gender", "Resident.MaritalStatus", and "Resident.Race".Follow the below steps to start the mapping process for Resident 360:1. In the left pane, go to **Resolve** > **Map**.2. Select the different tables and include all required attributes.![Alt image](/doc_snippets/Attributes_Resident360.png)3. From the drop-down list, select the **Primary key** that uniquely identifies a record. It should not include duplicate, missing, or null values.4. If you want to add a candidate key, select the **Select candidate key** checkbox.5. Select the **Candidate key** from the drop-down list.6. In the **Review mapped field**, select the semantic type for attributes.7. To configure various data cleansing techniques like converting all texts to lower/upper case, removing any spaces between strings, select **Advanced settings.**8. Click on each table and complete the mapping for the several types of required fields.9. Click **Save.**10. Once the application displays **Saved successfully**, click **Run** to start the mapping process.## Step 2: Select the Master data typeOnce the mapping is completed, add and select the master data type. It ensures that the new master data record is associated with the Resident 360 data model and inherits its attributes and properties. For more details, refer to the [add master data](https://docs.skypointcloud.com/docs/AddMasterData.html) section.Follow the below steps to select the master data type:1. Go to **Resolve > Unify**.2. Click **Add Master Data**.![Alt image](/doc_snippets/CreateMasterData_Resident.png)3. Enter the **Master Data name** and **Display name**.4. Select the type **Resident** from the dropdown list.5. Click **Save**.## Step 3: View profile detailsThe Resident 360 profiles page consists of features that enable you to choose certain attributes to create and define your profiles. You can further, filter or sort the profiles based on selected attributes to ease your analysis. For more details, refer to the [profiles](https://docs.skypointcloud.com/docs/customerprofiles.html) and [split indexer](https://docs.skypointcloud.com/docs/splitindexer.html) sections.1. Navigate to **Master Data > Profiles** page.2. Select the **Resident 360** master data from the drop-down menu. Each profile is displayed on a tile.![Alt image](/doc_snippets/Profile_Resident360.png)3. Click the **More** or **Less** option to expand or collapse the list of attributes on profile cards in a particular row.4. On the **Profiles** page, you can click on a tile and view the details of the desired profile.![Alt image](/doc_snippets/ProfileDetails_Resident360.png)
