# Creating and Editing Tables

- **Standard** - The standard tables are designed and configured by SkyPoint in accordance with best practices used across industries. The standard tables are compliant with **Modern Data Stack Platform (MDSP)** and collect the most common concepts to support core business application capabilities.
- **Custom** - The custom tables are new tables created in the Datavault environment. The user can customize the custom tables.
- **Activity** - The activity tables are special tables that store business data. The activity tables are imported into the environment as a part of a managed solution and are not customizable.

> The name of your table is the unique name across your environment. Once a table is created, the name cannot be changed as it may be referenced in your applications or code. The name has a prefix that has been automatically generated by the system. This prefix is intended to give your objects a unique name if you wish to import them into another environment in the future.

3. In the **Primary Name Column**, enter **Display name** and **Name**.
