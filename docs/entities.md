# **Exploring the Databases**

## **Overview**

A database is a collection of data or structured information. It consists of multiple rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents an attribute. A database may match the schema of an attribute that is a part of the Lakehouse, defining a common language for business data. Any data changes made through Lakehouse SQL will be synched to Lakehouse. The addition or deletion of records in a table through Lakehouse SQL updates the cosmos metadata.


## **To select and explore a Database**

For every import, SkyPoint adds a database to its analytical store known as Lakehouse.

1. In the left pane, go to the **Lakehouse** > **Databases**.

The **Databases** window appears. The storage is organized into three layers, namely:

- **Bronze** – Tables of raw data ingested from various sources in the Dataflow with every light transformation.
- **Silver** – Refined and transformed view of the data for example after Map in the MDM / Stitch process.
- **Gold** – Consumption and business level aggregate Tables such as Profiles (Customer, Employee, Organization etc.), Timelines, Audience, and Metrics.

2. Select a database to know more about the attributes and the data.
3. The **Attributes** tab is opened by default and shows a table.

In the Attributes page, you will see a tabular representation of all the attributes present inside that entity with their details.

:grey_exclamation: **Note** In the data tab, you will see a tabular representation of the data with its values. The Column option side panel drop-down fields have a search functionality with a search placeholder. The search functionality has been made easier for the user by adding a search feature on the Column Options drop-down fields. Users can type for any attributes in the Column Settings field. This avoids the scrolling required for the long list of attributes.

### To sort your Databases

## To download Comma Separated Value (CSV) file

You can download a CSV file (.csv format) that stores tabular data in plain text.

1. Go to the **Lakehouse** > **Databases**.
2. Select the attribute that you want to explore.
3. Click **Download as CSV** in the upper-right corner of the page to download the CSV file.

After a successful download, you can open the CSV file. You'll find detailed information about a list of attributes associated with the database.
