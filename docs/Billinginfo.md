# Changing Billing Settings
## Overview
The Billing info page enables you to check the current billing plan that you have been registered with SkyPoint Modern Data Stack Platform (MDSP). The ‘pay for what you use’ pricing model allows you to avoid spending on excess capacities that you don’t need right away. This gives you more flexibility to scale up by spending on your immediate needs.

The consumption-based pricing model offers you the following:
- $6.50 per SkyPoint Credit.
- A credit equals one hour of usage – billed per second with a one-minute minimum.
- Pay-as-you-go with no commitments or minimums.

## Prerequisite

- An active billing plan with SkyPoint MDSP.
