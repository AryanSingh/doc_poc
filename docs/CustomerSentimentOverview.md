# Analyzing Customer Sentiment
## Overview
You can use Customer sentiment analysis to derive your customers’ sentiment and the specific business aspects that they are concerned about with the help of their feedback. Sentiment analysis is the process of analyzing the opinion and feeling by examining a piece of text. This helps in gathering valuable insights on the customer’s viewpoint about a brand and helps you to stay ahead of the competition.

The SkyPoint Modern Data Stack Platform (MDSP) uses two Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to detect the customer sentiments. They are:  
- First, the customer feedback sentiments are extracted.
- Finally, the business aspects are discussed.

Both the above models are pre-trained and evaluated on representative public data that are labeled. However, you need to re-run the models to generate new results for the new feedback records in uploaded data tables.
## Prerequisites
You need to have the following customer feedback data to create a Customer Sentiment analysis:  
- Feedback ID
- Feedback date
- Feedback text.
