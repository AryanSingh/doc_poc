# Creating Customer churn model
## Overview
Customer retention is a top priority for any business. SkyPoint Modern Data Stack Platform (MDSP) offers to bring together various customer components through its Customer Churn Model tool. You can use it to understand the reason behind customer churns and estimate the risk associated with your customers. These insights will guide you to design a data-driven strategy for customer retention.
