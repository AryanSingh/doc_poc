# Creating a Choice

## Overview

Choices provide an exact list of values that the user can choose to ensure data consistency and improves the quality of the data. With the help of Choices, you can create meaningful reports. Similar to entities, choices are both types such as standard choices and custom choices.

## To create a choice

1. In the left pane of the SkyPoint Studio, open **Vault**.
2. Select the **Datavault** that you want to view the entities and choices.

4. Select **New Choice**.

A new window appears to create the choice.
