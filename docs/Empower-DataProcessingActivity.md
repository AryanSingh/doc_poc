# Data Processing Activities

## Overview

Data Processing Activities Application tracks data processing information in a central location, allowing you to locate, review, and delete relevant personal data in a timely manner. The Application is designed to assess the risk of data processing activities and improve security and data breach measures to safeguard sensitive data.

Consent for Data Processing refers to a process by which an organization obtains direct permission from users before processing their data.

SkyPoint Cloud helps you safely automate consent and preference management to get the most out of customer data.
