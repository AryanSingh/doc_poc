# Data processing activities

## Overview

Data protection and data management are key contributors to improving customer trust. Data processing activity tracks data processing information in a central location, allowing you to locate, review, and update relevant personal data. The application is designed to assess the risk of data processing activities and improve security and data breach measures to safeguard sensitive data.

Consent for data processing refers to a process by which an organization obtains permission from users before processing their data. Using consent flags, end users can give their consent on some specific activities for tracking or data processing. SkyPoint Cloud helps you safely automate consent and preference management to get the most out of customer data.
