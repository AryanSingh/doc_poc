# Viewing and Adding the Attributes

## Overview

Attributes store a discrete piece of information for an table. Every database in SkyPoint Datavault starts with a standard set of tables and each standard table has a standard set of attributes. You can create new attributes when existing standard attributes don't meet your requirements.

> [!TIP]
> Always use standard tables and attributes when possible. You can rename a table if that makes it more understandable in the context of your requirements.

## To view the attributes

1. In the left pane of the SkyPoint Studio, open **Vault**.
2. Select the **Datavault** and **Table** that has the attributes you want to view.

> The Name is the unique name across your environment. Based on the **Display name**, a **Name** will be auto-populated. You can edit it before creating the attribute. Once the attribute is created, the name cannot be changed as it may be referenced in your application or code.

3. Choose data type from the drop-down list.

> The data type of an attribute controls how values are stored as well as how they are formatted in some applications. For example, the currency is stored differently from a text or a URL. Depending on the data type, you will be prompted to specify the additional information for the data type. Once an attribute is saved, you cannot change the data type except for converting text attributes to auto number attributes.
